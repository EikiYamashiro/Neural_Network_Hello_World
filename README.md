# Neural Network with Tensorflow:

My first neural network, deep learning...

In the jupyter notebook file, the "mnist" dataset which consists of a set of 28x28 images of 0-9 digits written by hand is used. After the train-test split procedure, which consists of separating the images from the database in training set and test set, the neural network is assembled with the following layers: 1 Flatten Layer and 3 Dense Layers. The training period takes place in 3 epochs.

The accuracy obtained was 0.97.
